This clears pin 16 by writing 0b1 to bit 16 of the word below
Use this to turn a pin 'off' to turn off an LED directly connected here
mov r0,#0x10000
mov r1,#0x20200028
str [r1],r0


This sets pin 16 as an output, by writing 0b001 to bits 20..18 of the word below
mov r2,#0xFFF3FFFF
mov r3,#0x20200004
str [r3],r2


This turns on pin 16 by writing 0b1 to bit 16 of the word below
mov r4,#0x20200020
str [r4],r0


on:
	mov (1 logic) to pin16
	b(unconditional) wait

off:
	mov (0 logic) to pin16
	b(unconditional) wait

wait:
	<10000000 for loop to pause>
	bne off
	b(unconditional) on
